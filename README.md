# Passenger-Counter-App
Used to count the number of Passengers entering a subway and we can also save the count.
In this project I have added 3 buttons:
Enter:To increase the passengers entered using DOM and passing function on click.
Save:To add the present count to the previous entries.Here I have just used DOM to select respective paragraph and implemented string concatenation.
Clear:By clicking this button the count of people will be made to zero and the previous entries will also be removed.This is also attained using DOM.
The website is responsive.
I have also got to know that we should not use names like clear as function names in Javascript.
